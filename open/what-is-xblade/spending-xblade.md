# Spending OPEN

## Spending OPEN

To create and increase assets in wallet, players need to use OPEN to complete the in-game transactions. The more frequent players make in-game transactions the higher the value of OPEN is.

## How can players use OPEN?

At the moment, OPEN can be used to recruit up to 4 main characters, minting weapons and reforging weapons as well.

### Minting weapons

With certain amount of OPEN in wallet, players are able to build their own characters and forge weapons to go into battles with monsters in order to earn more OPEN. The amount of OPEN collected from combats depends on the strength level of monsters. Players are encouraged to purchase more OPEN to mint rare weapons as a means to get weapons with higher stats, which give them a chance to hold more OPEN in their wallet. The more OPEN players earn, the higher up their level goes and the more power they have on their weapons

### Reforging weapons

To burn weaker weapons and add stats to weapons, players need to proceed to “reforging” process, which consumes a great amount of OPEN to upgrade and boost the attack power of their weapons. Reforging weapons process ups the odds of winning in battles and makes it easier for players to sell their weapons on the marketplace
