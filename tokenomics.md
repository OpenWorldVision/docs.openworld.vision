### **Liquidity Provider Token**

The liquidity provider token of OpenWorld is OLP. OLP represents proof of depository and ownership in the asset pools that it is minted from. OLP can be minted using any asset in the liquidity pool and burnt to redeem any asset from the liquidity pool. The price of OLP is calculated by the total value of the liquidity pool including marked-to-market profits and losses of open positions divided by total OLP supply.

As OLP provides liquidity for traders by taking counter-position of the traders, OLP makes a profit when traders make a loss and vice versa. OLP is entitled to 70% of the profit generates from the chain-specific OpenWorld protocol (i.e. BSC OLP is entitled to 70% of profit generates from trading activities facilitated by OpenWorld in Binance Smart Chain specifically, BSC OLP has no bearing to profits or losses from let say HarmonyONE OLP).
