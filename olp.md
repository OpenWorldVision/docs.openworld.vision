# Buy Token: OPEN and OLP

### Getting into Crypto <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

As a decentralized exchange with no custody function, you will trade directly from your wallet and have full control of your fund. In order to trade, you need to have a crypto wallet yet, you can use MetaMask (or any other crypto wallet such as SafePal or Trust Wallet):

* [MetaMask Link](https://metamask.io/download.html)
* [SafePal Link](https://www.safepal.com/download)
* [Trust Wallet Link](https://trustwallet.com/)

### **Connecting Your Wallet**

After you have a wallet, you can connect your wallet by pressing the "Connect Wallet" button on the OpenWorld Trade page \[[Link](https://app.openworld.vision/#/trade)]&#x20;

Alternatively, you can manually add the Binance Smart Chain network through this Binance Academy instruction: \[[Link](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain)]

### Acquire Chain Native Token

As all trading and transactions happen on-chain and directly interacting with your wallet, you will need native token of the chain to pay gas fee.  At the current moment, OpenWorld only operate in BSC (with HarmonyONE to be added next), thus you will need to acquire some BNB to pay gas fee in order to make transactions.

The best way to buy BNB is to buy directly from Decentralized Exchanges that have the most liquidity on BSC, for that we recommend PancakeSwap ([Link](https://pancakeswap.finance/)).

### The OPEN Token <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Token can be purchased directly through Decentralize Exchanges such as PancakeSwap, 1Inch, or BogSwap. &#x20;

Owning OPEN means you are a contributor and a community member of the project.  Through voting, you can approve or deny changes that we later on introduce to the project.

### Stake OPEN for sOPEN

In order to access into revenue makes by OpenWorld protocol, you need to stake your OPEN.  After you stake OPEN through our \[Stake Page], you will receive sOPEN as a proof of stake.  The sOPEN you hold is a gateway for you to earn revenue of OpenWorld protocol during the specific monthly time period when you stake.  If you stake OPEN after the earning period has started, you are not eligible to receive a share of your earnings through your sOPEN.  If you unstake your OPEN before the earning period ends, you are not eligible to receive a share of your earnings through your sOPEN.

### The OLP Token <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

OLP consists of an index of assets used for swaps and leverage trading. It can be minted using any index asset and burnt to redeem any index asset.  The price for minting and redemption is calculated based on (the total worth of assets in index including profits and losses of open positions) / (OLP supply).  Note that the fees distributed are based on the number after deducting referral rewards and the network costs of keepers, keeper costs are usually around 1% of the total fees.&#x20;

Note that OLP is specific to the network you mint it on, it is not directly transferrable between networks and the price/rewards to the tokens will differ between networks.  As OLP holders provide liquidity for leverage trading, they will make a profit when leverage traders make a loss and vice versa.
