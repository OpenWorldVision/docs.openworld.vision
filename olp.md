# Buy Token: OPEN and OLP

### Getting into Crypto <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

As a decentralized exchange with no custody function, you will trade directly from your wallet and have full control of your fund. In order to trade, you need to have a crypto wallet yet, you can use MetaMask (or any other crypto wallet such as SafePal or Trust Wallet):

* [MetaMask Link](https://metamask.io/download.html)
* [SafePal Link](https://www.safepal.com/download)
* [Trust Wallet Link](https://trustwallet.com/)

### **Connecting Your Wallet**

After you have a wallet, you can connect your wallet by pressing the "Connect Wallet" button on the OpenWorld Trade page \[[Link](https://app.openworld.vision/#/trade)]&#x20;

If you see the message asking you to "Add Binance Smart Chain" to add the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network to your wallet, please click on the link.

Alternatively, you can manually add the Binance Smart Chain network through this Binance Academy instruction: \[[Link](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain)]

### Acquire Chain Native Token

As all trading and transactions happen on-chain and directly interacting with your wallet, you will need native token of the chain to pay gas fee.  At the current moment, OpenWorld only operate in BSC (with HarmonyONE to be added next), thus you will need to acquire some BNB to pay gas fee in order to make transactions.

The best way to buy BNB is to buy directly from Decentralized Exchanges that have the most liquidity on BSC, for that we recommend PancakeSwap ([Link](https://pancakeswap.finance/)).

### The OPEN Token <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Token can be purchased directly through Decentralize Exchanges such as PancakeSwap, 1Inch, or BogSwap. &#x20;

Owning OPEN means you are a contributor and a community member of the project.  Through voting, you can approve or deny changes that we later on introduce to the project.

### Stake OPEN for sOPEN

In order to access into revenue makes by OpenWorld protocol, you need to stake your OPEN.  After you stake OPEN through our \[Stake Page], you will receive sOPEN as a proof of stake.  The sOPEN you hold is a gateway for you to earn revenue from OpenWorld protocol during the specific monthly time period when you stake.  If you stake OPEN after the earning period has started, you are not eligible to receive a share of your earnings through your sOPEN.  If you unstake your OPEN before the earning period ends, you are not eligible to receive a share of your earnings through your sOPEN.

### The OLP Token <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

OLP is proof of stake of index assets that is contained within OpenWorld's asset pools.  The assets that are staked for OLP are used for trading.  OLP can be minted using any index asset and burnt to redeem any index asset at any time.  To unstake OLP, key in the amount of OLP to be unstaked and redeem accordingly.  Note that the fees distributed are based on the number after deducting referral rewards and the network costs of keepers, keeper costs are usually around 1% of the total fees.&#x20;

Staked OLP token address (BSC): \[Link]

As is noted on the Tokenomics page, OLP is chain-specific, which means that OLP from BSC Network cannot be transferred to HarmonyONE Network, for example, and redeem for HarmonyONE index assets.  &#x20;

### **Dynamic Rebalancing**

OLP's liquidity pools are targeted to balance around certain weights among its assets. These weights are not static and are dynamically adjusted according to market positions of traders. The token weights can be viewed in real-time at \[OLP Asset Pools Link]. The reason for rebalancing is to position and hedge the OLP liquidity pools from traders skewed exposure (collectively overly long or overly short) and thus reduce synthetic exposure of OLP holders to market directional risk.
