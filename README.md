OPEN is a decentralized spot and perpetual exchange that supports low swap fees and zero price impact trades.

Trading is supported by a unique multi-asset pool that earns liquidity providers fees from market making, swap fees, and leverage trading.

Dynamic pricing is supported by [Chainlink Oracles](https://chain.link/) and an aggregate of prices from leading volume exchanges.
