# Common Issues and Solutions


## 0.285 Gas Fee

Some transactions are not allowed in the contract such as adding a 5th character or trading a weapon with a trading blockade. If you do this by accident, you will have to pay 0.285BNB for this. So please illustrate the concept of each transaction and ensure that it is valid and enforceable before proceed to further steps.

## EVM Error

You might receive EVM errors if you start your fight before the hourly reset. Every hour the old enemy list disappears and the new one is refreshed according to UTC time zone. For that reason, you should not execute your transaction in the middle of this process; otherwise your transaction will fail as your reference goes directly to the old enemy list. To avoid this, we suggest you to stop fighting one hour before and wait until the refresh is complete to avoid failed transaction.
