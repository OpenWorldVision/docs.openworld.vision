Off-chain refers to traditional games in which gameplay code is executed on the developer's own servers. Such games are liable to DDOS attacks since all the game code is running on one central location.

Blockchain-based gaming like CryptoWar has a distinct advantage. Players donâ€™t necessarily have to play game through the website. Assuming player knows how to interact with blockchain, they will be able to make the best use of special features on smart contracts such as calling the appropriate functions and supplying the necessary data on the BscScan contract pages.

Another advantage of being on-chain is that each transaction performed by the users can be tracked and verified by checking TxIDs on BscScan. Assets can also be tracked and traced as they transfer from one user to another, all the way back to when it was first minted.
