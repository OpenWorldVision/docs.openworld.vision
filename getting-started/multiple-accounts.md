# Multiple Accounts

Due to the use of robust time frame, CryptoWar allows players to have multiple accounts with 4 characters for each to access the game. However, each of these accounts is restricted to have their own weapon as the 24 hour trade lock prevents trading the same weapon between accounts. Besides, gas fees are compulsory being maintained in each account to pay for transaction processing fees. The more accounts each player has the more gas fees he or she has to pay

You can create multiple accounts in your MetaMask wallet as follows.

Click on the favicon on the upper right side of your screen and select "Create Account".
