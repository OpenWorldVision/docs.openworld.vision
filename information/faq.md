CryptoWar is a web-based role playing game that emulates traditional games . Players will battle monsters or complete in-game raids to earn xBlade tokens. To help with battles, players can craft weapons to build an advantage over their opponents or boost their power. These items can then be traded in an open marketplace.

The gameplay itself is straightforward. There are four main components – fire, earth, air and water – allocated to each character, weapon, attribute and enemy. Each component will have its strengths and weaknesses, which players must then utilize and build strategies to beat their opponents.

* Native crypto token: xBlade
