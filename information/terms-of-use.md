# Terms of Use

The "Terms of Use" are indeed a legally binding agreement between you and CryptoWar Team regarding access to our website www.cryptowar.network, CryptoWar Team apps, and other digital devices directly linked to our apps such as media form, media channel, mobile website, or mobile application (referred to as the "Site" or "App"). CryptoWar is a decentralized application that runs on the Ethereum Network, Loom Network, and BINANCE SMART CHAIN (collectively, the "Blockchains") and makes use of specially-developed smart contracts ("Smart Contracts") to enable you to execute in-game transactions and facilitate the formation of a hybrid crypto currency. Furthermore, you are given the ability to own and trade various digital assets, such as lands and items, which may then be displayed on the website and used to interact with it. You may be able to monitor their assets using the "App" (the common name for both the Smart contract and the Site), as well as conduct in-game transactions as well as trade hybrid creatures with other App users/players. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so and that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case the terms "you" and "we, us, our" as used in these Terms shall refer to that entity.

### 5. FEE AND PAYMENT

‌

If you elect to purchase, trade, or mint Cryptowars NFTs, then we will release additional NFTs from time to time, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Blockchain via a wallet such as MetaMask or Ronin Wallet. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Site and/or the App or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum,

‌

Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee \(a “Gas Fee”\) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.

‌

In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of 4.25% of the total value of that transaction \(each, a “Commission”\). You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the BINANCE SMART CHAIN as a part of the transaction.

‌

As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments \(except taxes on our net income\) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority \(collectively, “Taxes”\) associated with your use of the App \(including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, or breeding of any of your NFTs\). Except for income taxes levied on CryptoWar Team, you: \(i\) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local, or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value-added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and \(ii\) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.

### 11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

‌

11.1 Informal negotiations

‌

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use \(each a “Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes"\) brought by either you or us \(individually, a “Party" and collectively, the “Parties"\), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute \(except those Disputes expressly provided below\) informally for at least thirty \(30\) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

‌

11.2 Binding Arbitration

‌

If a Party is unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Disputes \(except those Disputes expressly excluded below\) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association \(“AAA"\) and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes \(“AAA Consumer Rules"\), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitration compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all the arbitration fees and expenses. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AA rules or applicable law, the arbitration can take place in the Cayman Islands. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator.

‌

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in the Cayman Islands, and the Parties hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.

‌

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site, the App and the Smart Contracts be commenced more than one \(1\) year after the cause of the action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

‌

11.3 Exceptions to the Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

‌

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provision concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: \(a\) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, and of the intellectual property rights of a Party, \(b\) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and \(c\) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal and unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

### 14. ASSUMPTION OF RISK

‌

You accept and acknowledge each of the following:

‌

B. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Cryptowar-related transactions. CryptoWar Team is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.

‌

C. The App does not store, send, or receive NFTs. This is because NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain on the BINANCE SMART CHAIN. Any transfer of NFTs occurs only on the BINANCE SMART CHAIN.

‌

D. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that CryptoWar Team will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the BINANCE SMART CHAIN, however caused.

‌

E. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Cryptowar ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of NFTs.

‌

F. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Cryptowar ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of NFTs.

‌

G. Upgrades by CryptoWar Team to the game may have unintended, adverse effects on all CryptoWar Team assets.

‌
