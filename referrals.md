# Referrals

## The Referral Program

To create a referral code:

* Go to [https://app.openworld.vision/#/referrals](https://app.openworld.vision/#/referrals)
* Click on the Referral tab
* Create a referral code using any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores

The referral codes are chain specific.  Meaning if you want to refer to both chain BSC and HarmonyONE, you need to create 2 referral codes, one for each chain.

Once you've had your code, you can copy the referral link and send it to your audience, your link should look have this format: [https://openworld.vision/#/?ref=\<your code>](https://openworld.vision/#/).

You can share this link on any social platform.  When a trader registers to OpenWorld using your link, her account is embedded with your referral code on the smart contract level.  Your referree will get a discount meanwhile you get a rebate using your referral code, regardless of where or what device the trader trades from.

The discounts and rebates will be distributed as OPEN every Monday, your rebates history will be viewable on [https://app.openworld.vision/#/referrals](https://app.openworld.vision/#/referrals).

Note that the referral program is subject to change as the project goes along and the market conditions.  If we make the change, it will be through protocol proposal and should be able to be voted upon by the community.  Full referral terms at [https://openworld.vision/#/referral-terms](https://openworld.vision/#/referral-terms).

## Tiers

The referral program has a tier system to prevent gaming through self-referrals, this helps to ensure that referrers receive the rebates for the users they brought onto the platform.&#x20;

* Tier 1: 5% discount for traders, 5% rebates to referrer
* Tier 2: 10% discount for traders, 10% rebates to referrer
* Tier 3: 10% discount for traders, 15% rebates to referrer

Anyone can create a Tier 1 code. To upgrade your code to Tier 2 or Tier 3:

* Tier 2: At least 15 active users using your referral codes per week and a combined weekly volume above $5 million
* Tier 3: At least 30 active users using your referral codes per week and a combined weekly volume above $25 million

If your account meets this criteria, please submit the application form at https://forms.gle/. After filling in the form please send a dm to [@OpenWorldPartners](https://t.me/openworldglobal) so that we can follow up.

Rebates and discounts apply on the opening and closing fees for leverage trading.

The opening and closing fees are 0.1% each on OpenWorld, as there is no price impact for trades on perpetual market, the referrers earn on the full maker fee and from what would otherwise be spread on other exchanges.  Thus, referrers would earn rebates on actual trading volume on OpenWorld and these are typically higher than earnings from similar programs thanks to the different in price slippage and spreads.

Institutional referral such as wallet providers, NFT projects, and protocols will be eligible for Referral Program as well.
