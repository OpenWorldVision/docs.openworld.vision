# OpenWorld Team

OpenWorld has 10+ team members in a group of diverse and complemented backgrounds: computer science, venture capital, private equity, digital media, and business operation. The core team knows each other personally and have worked together for 10+ years over various ups and downs in multinational firms as well as high growth VC-backed startups.

We experience first hand short-coming of DeFi and GameFi by projects we built on: DeFi solves the depository issue by offering high yields, however DeFi protocols in the market lack a channel to direct those funds into value creating projects in order to make even higher yields to pay back the depositors.  GameFi P2E is a financially unsustainable business model where the value of the gamersâ€™ earnings is mainly financed either by investors or late comers, meanwhile GameFi PvP creates win-lose situation between gamers and is very close to gambling.

Still, we also acknowledge the power of blockchain in decentralizing finance and create, for the first time in human history, an authentic and true digital ownership with digital assets.  Shaken by the recent collapse of FTX and risks of centralize finance continue to bring to users as well as inspired by developments from DeFi space from DEX to innovative perpetual trading exchanges, we think of building OpenWorld to be a financial house.  This is our effort to bring the beauties of what the financial industry have developed through out hundreds of years into crypto space and do it in a decentralized way.  Finance is an extremely complicated area and so is blockchain.  The most difficult breakthrough that blockchain needs to do is to offer real value and tangle with the real life, into the people of the main streets.  Thus we hope OpenWorld to play a role in that breakthrough, connecting people from crypto area to financial assets developed from traditional finance space.  Bring blockchain technology to finance industry.  Provide opportunities and risks from financial assets that are not easily approachable (such as exposure to US indexes) to many people on the planet with just a smart device, internet connection, and a crypto wallet.

That is the quest of democratize finance.&#x20;
