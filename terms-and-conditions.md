[OPEN](https://openworld.vision/) does not endorse or assume any responsibility for such resources or promotions. Suppose you access any such resources or participate in any such promotions. In that case, you do so at your own risk and understand that these Terms do not apply to your dealings or relationships with any third parties. You expressly relieve [OPEN](https://openworld.vision/) of all liability arising from using such resources or participating in such promotions.
* 6.3. You understand that the BSC blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Interface, in addition to uncertainty relating to digital assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the BSC blockchain is variable and may increase at any time, causing an impact on any activities taking place on these blockchains, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Interface.
* 6.4. Transactions entered into in connection with the Interface are irreversible and final, and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Interface at your own risk.
* 6.5. We must comply with Applicable Law, which may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take certain actions or provide information that may not be in your best interests.
* 6.6. You hereby assume and agree that [OPEN](https://openworld.vision/) will have no responsibility or liability for the risks in Section 9. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against openworld.vision, its affiliates, and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, suppliers, and contractors related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 6.
