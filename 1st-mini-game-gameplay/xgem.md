# ðŸ’Ž xGem

We are excited to announce that new currency xGem has been successfully added to the game to reward players from playing PvE mode ( randomly from 1-3 xGem / 1 fight )

xGem is NOT a token that means you can not trade it for other tokens or transfer to others like xBlade. xGem has it's own special mission in the game, it can be CW's stable coin in future.

You can use xGem to purchase special NFTs in the shop, for now it is Blind Box and more interesting NFTs are on the way.

Blind Box contains many valuable NFTs : a Hero or random star Weapon that mean it can be worth from hundreds to thousands xBlade depend on how lucky you are.
