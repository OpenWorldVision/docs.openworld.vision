# xBlade Flow

Firstly, all of OPEN that spends in PvP mode is from wallet only.

Secondly, when you win a fight OPEN will go to " PvP Reward Pool " . You can claim it to wallet, it cost 0 tax. PvP and PvE have different reward pool, please remember that.

If you win, you'll have to pay 5% OPEN of Amount a match for tax and earn 95% rest.

If you lose, you lost 100% OPEN Amount a match

So check out OPEN in your wallet, some BNB for gas fee and you're good to go. Have fun and Good luck !
