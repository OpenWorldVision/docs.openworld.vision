OpenWorld characters are the most important NFTs as they are the essential pillar for success of every battle. Players must possess at least one character in their account and each account can hold a maximum of 8 characters.

Click on the button in the Plaza tab to pay for the fee to mint character. All OPEN spent on minting characters is sent directly to the contract so as to handle fight payouts. Once players finished this process, they receive a character at level 1 with a random element.

Currently there is no method for changing the element of a character.

## CWC

CWC stands for OpenWorld Character, which directly corresponds to NFTs present in your wallet.

If you want your CWC to be visible to your MetaMask wallet, you may add the token through its contract address found below:

Set the decimal to "0" if prompted.
{% endhint %}

## Character Elements

Each character has one of four different elements (Fire, Earth, Air, Water).

Character elements are used to determine advantage calculations and multipliers in each combat.

Further information on how to use character elements can be found here:

## Stamina

Each character has their own stamina pool with a maximum count of 200.

Stamina regenerates over time by one point every 7 minutes for level 1, and increase until 17 minutes/stamina.

When a player engages in combat, stamina is depleted at a rate of 40/80/120/160/200 stamina per fight, depending on the player's chosen stamina fetched per fight.
