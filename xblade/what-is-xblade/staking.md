# Staking

Besides engaging in battles to earn more xBlade, staking is regarded as the mainstay of acquiring xBlade. However, it is advisable for players to keep tabs on the currency value of xBlade before proceeding to ultimate decision on withdrawing the rewards. 

Hence, there are some practical suggestions concerning this issue. 

Once players staked their xBalde, they are not acceptable to approach to their xBlade for 7 days. 

If players decide to withdraw xBlade immediately or don’t want to wait 7 days, a 15% tax will be applied to withdrawal. 

In case players stake unclaimed xBlade, it can be withdrawn into players’ MetaMask with no tax applied. 

The 7-day locking period of the staking will be rebooted whenever a withdrawal is made for any amount. This feature will enable players to keep the ball rolling.
