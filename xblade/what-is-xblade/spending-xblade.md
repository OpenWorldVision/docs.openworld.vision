# Spending xBlade

## Spending xBlade

To create and increase assets in wallet, players need to use xBlade to complete the in-game transactions. The more frequent players make in-game transactions the higher the value of xBlade is.

## How can players use xBlade?

At the moment, xBlade can be used to recruit up to 4 main characters, minting weapons and reforging weapons as well.

### Minting weapons

With certain amount of xBlade in wallet, players are able to build their own characters and forge weapons to go into battles with monsters in order to earn more xBlade. The amount of xBlade collected from combats depends on the strength level of monsters. Players are encouraged to purchase more xBlade to mint rare weapons as a means to get weapons with higher stats, which give them a chance to hold more xBlade in their wallet. The more xBlade players earn, the higher up their level goes and the more power they have on their weapons

### Reforging weapons

To burn weaker weapons and add stats to weapons, players need to proceed to “reforging” process, which consumes a great amount of xBlade to upgrade and boost the attack power of their weapons. Reforging weapons process ups the odds of winning in battles and makes it easier for players to sell their weapons on the marketplace
