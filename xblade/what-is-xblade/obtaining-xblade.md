# Obtaining xBlade

The important objective of getting this game on board lies in nurturing a sustainable emerging economy along with building a favorable ecosystem of XNB where all echelon of gamers as well as long term traders can enjoy the game. Therefore, there are various methods to earn xBalde in game, such as: 

## Combat/ Fighting

Before each battle, players are required to recruit their own character, forging their weapon as well as picking an enemy from a randomized list based on the strength of their character. All these processes are performed on-chain.

Further information on the combat calculations can be found here:

## Eanring Calculator

A calculator system has been ensconced in game by CryptoWar in which the player can input and exchange dollar value for xBlade and BNB, as well as the stats of their current character and selected weapon.

Potential daily and monthly earnings will then be displayed in the system based on the win-rate when compared with daily fights.

The leveling potential of each character is not calibrated by the calculator. Because of the rapid pace of game for lower-level character, it must be better to perform new calculations when the mentioned character hits the next milestone subsequently.

## Claiming xBlade

xBlade gained after each battle will be reflected in player’s Rewards bar on the upper left hand side of the screen. Please select the gear icon on the upper right hand side of the screen and activate the Rewards bar in case it maintains invisibility.
 
When the player claims from the rewards pool, he or she may be liable for the Early Withdraw Tax which is elucidated below.

## Early Withdraw Tax

Each player is subject to an Early Withdraw Tax which disincentives the day-to-day withdrawing and sale of xBlade.

The tax preliminarily starts at 15% and gradually decreases by 1% per day until it sinks to the lowest point of 0%.

The tax will be reverted to the starting point (15%) if the player withdraw xBlade or stakes unclaimed xBlade on the staking pool.

Those, who attempt to avoid the tax, kindly find the attached below for your further consideration:
