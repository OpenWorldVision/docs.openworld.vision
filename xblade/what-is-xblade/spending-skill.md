# Spending xBlade

xBlade is the currency used to create and enhance the asset NFTs players use to play the game. Over time, more use cases will be created to increase the value of xBlade and circulate the economy of the game.

## In Game Only Funds

In-Game-Only xBlade is xBlade that can only be spent on minting weapons, and reforging.

In-Game-Only cannot be spent on the marketplace to purchase NFTs.

This xBlade is currently unobtainable at the moment, though this maybe subject to change depending on future features.

## xBlade Spending Order

CryptoWar will prioritize spending xBlade in the following order for minting characters, weapons, and reforging:

1. In-Game-Only
2. Unclaimed xBlade
3. Wallet xBlade

If one pool of xBlade is insufficient for the transaction, CryptoWar will take xBlade from the next pool in the list above to satisfy the cost.

## Minting Characters
