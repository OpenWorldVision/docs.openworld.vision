**Buy a bond**

Type in details of your purchase: amount, check details and finish an on-chain transaction.

Assume to buy 12-month bond

Pay your attention on warning message if you buy a specific bond more than once

> _You have an existing mint. Minting will reset your vesting period and forfeit any pending claimable rewards. We recommend claiming rewards first or using a fresh wallet. Do you still wish to proceed?_

If you buy a specific bond for a first time, you won’t see this message.

What does it means?

* Your vesting period will reset to 0
* Pending Claimable reward will reset to 0

So if you buy OPEN bond on 7th July 2022, and want to buy other bonds on 14th July 2022, 21th July 2022, etc., we strongly advise you to use a new wallet for this purpose. Else, you will have to wait longer to claim your previous Bond(s).

However, if you have plans to buy multiple times, in short period of time, within a few minutes, you can do it with a single wallet. Because reset does not have big effect in this case.

When your on-chain transaction finished, you will see a notification

**Redeem your claimable reward**

Let the count down timer runs and redeem your rewards if you want to.

When you claim it, click on Redeem and you must make another on-chain transaction. In order to save fee, you can claim your reward when vesting time completes. Note that vesting time is linear, and you can claim reward anytime you want, if you don’t mind about transaction fee.

**ROI note**

* ROI of each bond will be changed by market price
