After players choose their enemy, an on-chain smart contract performs quick calculations to announce the ultimate winner depending on the highest roll.

The victors of each battle are showered with XP and OPEN in playersâ€™ in-game wallet.

Players must pay a certain amount of gas fees if their character is defeated by their enemies
