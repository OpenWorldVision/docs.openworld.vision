# Characters

## Your First Character

Players can proceed with their profit-oriented strategies by minting their first hero and acquiring a 1-star weapon compatible with its hero at no cost. It is acceptable for players to mint four characters at the same time. Be that as it may, they are far-fetched to possess similar elements. There are numerous tactics to fetch a powerful weapon for your heroes such as purchasing them on market place, keeping minting or selling those that donâ€™t closely correspond to your desirable element. (For example: a Fire sword should be a perfect match 4 Fire heroes)

On the assumption that players have enough money for purchasing leveled characters as they can depend on experience of playing which is time consuming.

Purchasing characters can also be a good way to get an auspicious bullish opening but do not overlook the weapon

## Mono Element Composition

In case players possess an excellent 4-star or 5-star sword of whichever element, it is recommendable to gain four characters of the same element who can share and employ similar sword. Minting a character turns out to be the lowest-cost method to acquire your wanted character. However, the current state of the game encourages players to form a mono-element team which empowers them to make the best use of just a single sword

## When to claim experience ?

Level milestones are considered to be an essential pillar of maintaining character experience.

Please keep an eye on time when your characters are on the verge to reach the next milestone. In case one of them has crossed the threshold, remember to restrain from engaging in fighting and claiming the much sought after experience.
